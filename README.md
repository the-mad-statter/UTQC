Unreal Tournament 2004 Quick Executer

This program makes it easier to use Unreal Tournament 2004 in a psychological laboratory setting by providing a way for participants to easily connect to either an individual or team-based game.

The server IP is configurable by the principal investigator along with a port for an individual game and a port for a team-based game. That way, the server can run on a different computer than the participant's computer.
